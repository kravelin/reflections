When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to work from multiple systems, or work on a team project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- reduce bandwidth usage and ensure only the code you want is pulled from the remote site that may have been uploaded by another user
