When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to work from multiple systems, or work on a team project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- reduce bandwidth usage and ensure only the code you want is pulled from the remote site that may have been uploaded by another user

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- fork is used to copy one github repository to another github repository. Clone is to copy one repository to another, either locally or remotely (including the forking on github). Branches are differing lines of code within a repository. Branches are used for code variation, clones are for making local copies of remote repositories usually, and forking is when you want to work off of someone elses repository on github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- allows us to know if our local copy is ahead or behind the remote copy and will require a merge to put them in sync and possibly have coflicts to resolve.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- would probably communicate via chat service and/or email, sending files through those methods or ftp to a shared space. Communication may be easier with chat service but sharing and updating files would be harder.
